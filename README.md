## Reflection
Building this Task Management App was both challenging and rewarding. One major challenge I faced was managing the task status updates while maintaining clean, readable code. I had to redo my code in my app sevral times to ensure it was more modular and dynamic. Implementing filtering and overdue status updates required me to practice and apply multiple JavaScript concepts like date comparisons, array methods, and DOM manipulation.

I overcame these challenges by breaking the problem into smaller functions, testing frequently, and reading documentation. If given more time, I would improve the UI and possibly add animations or drag-and-drop functionality for tasks. This project helped me solidify my understanding of local storage and reinforced best practices in front-end JavaScript development.
I love the App.js & scipt.js  files and would love to learn more javascript to do more functions and intergrate styling with css.
